# Overview
This program is a demonstration of the C# programming language. I have programmed a very basic program that is a simple Tic Tac Toe game. It is seemingly easy, or a beginner program, but for me it wasn't that easy! It is a two player game with user input and a way to determine who has won, or if the game is a draw. 

# Software
I have used Visual Studio to accomplish writing my program in C# language. This proved difficult. I used most of my time trying to figure out how to make a simple "Hello World" program to work, before I started my own program. After searching the internet and asking others for help, I was able to find this website which helped me tremendously!

I need to put kudos here for MWPreston whose blog this was that had had the same struggles as I did and he wanted to share what he learned so he could help others.

# Description
To describe this game, it is Tic Tac Toe. It is a two player game. One player is "X" and one player is "O". Each player takes a turn to place their token on the board by replacing the numbered square on the board with thier respective token. If they get three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the will be the winner. If no player is able to get three in a row, the player with the most tokens on the board will win. If both players have the same amount of tokens on the board, the game is a draw.

# Purpose
I am demonstrating my knowlegde of the C# Language that I have been learning and want to show what I am capable of doing with this programming language. As a Software Engineer, I will need to have a working knowledge of the C# programming language along with the Java programming language. I will continue to delve deeper as I have learned and hope to master it one day.

# Future Work
* I would like to make a window with a smoother tic tac toe board and just a click to place your token
* I want to make sure that all the detections of win, lose, or draw are correct and no errors.
* I would also like to have a choice to do a two player or play the computer.
